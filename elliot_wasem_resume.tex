\section{Projects}
\cventry{DexterityDB}{Virtual Filesystem}{Rust}{}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed and implemented a virtual filesystem implemented in Rust.
        \item Ensured that it was the minimum needed to work with our database software so as to run lean and efficiently.
        \item This project reduced the file descriptors we needed open from upwards of a million down to just a small handful.
    \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{Personal}{Personal Password Manager}{Rust}{}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Password manager implemented in Rust.
        \item Uses \href{https://github.com/davatorium/rofi}{Rofi} as a graphical user interface.
        \item Allows locally storing passwords in a secure manner, all locked behind a master password.
        \item The beauty of this password manager is that, even with in-depth knowledge of how it works, it is impossible to read the password file without knowing the master password.
    \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{Personal}{Personal Website}{HTML, CSS, JavaScript}{}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item My personal website tries to let the user experience the computer the way I do on a daily basis: through the commandline.

\cventry{Academic, Teaching Assistant, CS511}{TinyChat}{Erlang}{}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed and setup groundwork for assignment for students in the Fall 2019 semester.
        \item Assignment is to create an IRC chat application, implemented completely in Erlang.
        \item Purpose of assignment is to give students a full understanding of message passing.
        \item The project is designed such that it would only take a few lines more of code to turn this into a fully distributed, centralized messaging application. However for the purpose of this assignment, it was designed so that processes were all locally running on a single computer.
    \end{itemize}
